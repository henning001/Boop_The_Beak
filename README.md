# Boop_The_Beak
Challenge your friends to a multiplayer client-server shooter game!<br><br>
To score points, you must shoot the beaks of the ducks only. Some ducks are worth more points and are harder to hit.<br>
The goal is to be extremely accurate! If you miss once, you can no longer shoot. Shooting a secret object will grant an extra shot!<br>

To play:
1) Enter IP of server host (Can leave IP field blank if local play)
2) Enter port number (I use port 1 for testing)
3) START SERVER BEFORE ANY CLIENTS
4) Start all clients
5) Set up your settings and press ready
6) Shoot out!
